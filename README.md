# scss-spacing
Basic css utility spacers written in scss

Change the $unit variable from "rem" to "px" or "em" to change the spacer metric.

Change the $maxRange variable from 5 to whatever to generate additional classes.

Each iteration will produce a margin and padding class as well as their respective (top, left, right, bottom) classes.

examples: 

m-0 = margin:0;

m-t-0 = margin-top:0;

p-b-0 = padding-bottom: 0;

m-t-0-5 = margin-top: .5;

etc..
